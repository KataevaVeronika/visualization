# Crime in USA

The project allows an exploration of statistical data on crimes committed in the US between 2001 and 2016.   

The map illustrates the murder percentage of total crimes in each state by year. The linear graph on the left shows the number of crimes by the type they belong to. The graph on the right investigates the number of murders by the weapons utilized.  

The visualization is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://emidiant.github.io/crime-in-usa-visualisation/).  

The project is developed in a group of two and stored [here](https://github.com/Emidiant/crime-in-usa-visualisation).  

**Areas of responsibility:**
-   Data formatting and processing
-   Developing two line charts, including defining axes, developing select boxes
